Hello, this is my implementation of similar functionality to the well known music streaming platform Spotify.
This is meant as a personal project, this product will never be made for commercial use.
In this repository, there are some files intentionally missing to not infringe any copyright rules or give github any reason to make this repo provate or even remove it.
This C# application is meant to create a similar interface to that of Spotify for Desktop computers, and it has 2 modes: admin and user.
The admin mode is accessed through the log in page by entering the credentials "admin" for user and "admin" for password, allowing the administrator to add, remove, change, simply put, he can manipulate the database
through an easy to use interface.
The user must register first and only then can they access the Spotify interface to listen to music, search for albums, songs and artists. They can add friends that already have an account and see their favorite albums.
When it comes to listening to music, the song can be interacted with through the menu at the bottom of the app, just like Spotify.
They can also see their profile, or their friends profile, which can be accessed from the friends list.
This project is meant to be seen by recruitersm so if you are one and encounter any problems with running the code, please contact me at bazareaeduard123@gmail.com and I will do my best to solve the issue.
